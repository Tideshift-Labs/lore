# Testing guide — Lore fork (our deltas)

**The `lore-test-specialist` agent loads this doc at the start of every run, and appends to it at the
end.** Lore is Epic's mature, FOSS, binary-first VCS engine; we maintain a fork on `tideshift/main`
with a handful of our own commits. This guide is **only about testing OUR deltas** — not Epic's engine
— plus build/test gotchas on our setup. Keep it dense; point to Lore's own docs (`CONTRIBUTING.md`,
per-crate docs) and the `rust-best-practices` / `rust-async-patterns` skills for depth.

> This file lives on `tideshift/main` only. It is **excluded from the per-CR branches** we send
> upstream to EpicGames — keep those PRs scoped to code.

## Classify first — SERVER vs CLIENT

- **[SERVER]** — `lore-server` / `lore-aws` / `lore-proto` etc. Low-risk: we control the build and run
  it. Most of our patches. Test pragmatically against our usage.
- **[CLIENT]** — `lore` / `lore-client` / `lore-revision` / CLI path. Higher-risk, gated on upstream
  merge; test to an EpicGames-reviewer bar and place tests where upstream expects.

## How tests are organized

Large cargo workspace. Match each crate's existing test style — read a neighboring suite + the crate's
docs before adding one.

- **Unit** — co-located `#[cfg(test)]` modules. `cargo test -p <crate>` for the crate in scope (don't
  rebuild the whole workspace for a one-crate change).
- **Integration** — `lore-integration-tests` + per-crate `tests/`; heavier, may need fixtures/backends.

## Gates (match `lore-reviewer`'s bar)

- `cargo test`
- `cargo +nightly fmt --all`
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings --no-deps` (zero warnings)
- Engine code standards: **no `unwrap`/`expect` in non-test code**, layered `thiserror`→`LoreError`,
  `lore_spawn!`-only task spawning, SPDX headers, DCO `Signed-off-by` on anything intended to upstream.

## Our deltas (keep current — which crates we've touched + how they're tested)

Per the `lore-fork-patches-inventory`: our `tideshift/main` commits are mostly SERVER-side
(loreserver / lore-aws / v1 gRPC), with one client-path change (native TLS roots in `lore-transport`,
not the CLI itself). As you test a delta, record here **which crate it's in and how it's covered**, so
the next run starts from the map instead of rediscovering it.

_(seed entries as runs surface them)_

## Deep findings / gotchas (append as discovered)

> Add an entry whenever something cost a real debugging/churn cycle. Format **symptom → cause → what to
> do**, with a `cargo` command or `file:line`. Terse. If a finding generalizes beyond testing, flag it
> for a close-out learning/skill (or a `lorehub/docs/lore-change-requests/` note).
